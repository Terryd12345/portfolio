                    My philosophy when it comes to software is that great software products are fundamentally about <b>solving problems</b>. There is no one size fits all when it comes to software as different technologies are designed to solve different problems. <b>Trying to force a technology to fit a solution that it is not designed for can lead to poor performance and an overall bad experience for the user</b>. Being able to understand the <b>tradeoffs</b> between these technologies and understanding which technology to use is crucial to the success of a project.
